                <h1>The Sun</h1>
                <p class="intro">The Sun or Sol is the star at the centre of our solar system and is responsible for the Earth’s weather and climate changes. </p>
                
                <p>The Sun is almost perfect sphere with a difference of just 10km i diameter between the poles and the equator.The average radius of the Sun is 695,508km (109.2 X that of the earth) of which 20-25% is the core.</p>
                
                <p>If a hollow Sun was filled up with spherical Earths then around 960,000 would fit inside. On the other hand if these Earths were squished inside with no wasted space then around 1,300,000 would fit inside. The Sun surface area is 11,990 times that of Earth's</p>
