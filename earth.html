                <h1>Earth</h1>
                <p class="intro">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the largest of the terrestrial planets.</p>
                
                <p>The Earth was formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago and is the only known planet to support life.</p>
                
                <p>The Earth is the only planet in our solar system not to be named after a Greek or Roman deity.</p>
                
                <p>The Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing. This deceleration is happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per hundred years, although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our days, but it happens so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length of a day will have increased to 25 hours.</p>
